=> What is dictionary? How do we add elements in dictionary? What are methods to add?
=> What are the methods to print keys or values and both keys and values?
=> What is Tuple?

1. Dictionaries are used to manipulate the data by storing data in from of keys and value pairs.
   =>We canNot us indexing in dict.
   Ex:- programming = {"library": "books", "number":23}
   Their are three methods to add data to dict.
=> By adding key value pair at the end of dictionary by specifing coma
=> programming = {"library": "books", "number":23}
   programming["contacts"] = "numbers"
=> programming.update({"shop": "items"})

2. Ex:- Getting Both keys and Values 
   programming = {"library": "books", "number":23}
   programming["contacts"] = "numbers"
   for key, value in programming.items():
       print(key, value)
   OUTPUT:-
   library books
   number 23
   contacts numbers

   Ex:- Getting keys and Values  SEPERATELY
   programming = {"library": "books", "number":23}
   programming["contacts"] = "numbers"
   for key in programming.keys():
       print(key)
   OUTPUT:-
      library 
      number
      contacts
   for value in programming.values():
       print(value)
   OUTPUT:-
      books 
      23
      numbers


* Keys in dict are immutable and values are mutable.
  EX:-
     programming = {"nums": [1,2,3]}
     print(programming)


3. Tuple:-
   Tuples are immutable, data stored in () parenthesis. We cannot do indexing to get data. 
  Ex:- Tuple are mostly used in dead lock situations.
     a = (1,2,3,4)
     print(a[0]) // error 

** => Difference between numpy in list to list.
   nums = [1,2,3]
   print(3*nums)

   import numpy as np
   nums = np.array([1,2,3])
   print(3*nums)

   OUTPUT:-
   [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
   [3 6 9]
